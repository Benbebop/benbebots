Hello family fans. Welcome to 2023, sadly we have some bad news. 
Family guy bot will be shutting down some time this year due to the upcoming decomission of the discord api v7 (https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/4725). Worry not for family guy bot development is not concluding, there are plans to move from the depricated Discordia 2.0 api to something newer at some point.
We hope that family guy bot will provide you with laughs and gaffs for the next couple of months. See you in the future!
