# Benbebot

Benbebot is a family of a couple of discord bots all here in this repository. Currently, there is good old Benbebot (Main Bot) and Family Guy.

# Benbebot Help

If you have just added Benbebot or are looking to, here is all the stuff he can do (at the moment, its always being expanded). All commands are to be ran by just typing in a chat `bbb <command> [args]`.

* Download videos from almost any service (a full list of supported sites can be found [here](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)).
	This can be done with the command `download [<format>] <url>`
* Run a gmod server.
	A gmod server can be ran with the command `gmod <gamemode>`. Then to set the map you will want to use `getmaps` and\or `mapinfo <map>` to figure which map you want, then use `setmap <map>` to set the map (this can be done at any point).
* @\everything
	ping every role, member and channel in a server

Short list I know (it used to be alot bigger, check out the [old repository](https://github.com/Benbebop/BenbebotOld) if intrested).

# Adding Benbebot bots to your server

In order to get Benbebot on your server you will need to reach out or be contacted by me, too bad so sad.

As for Family Guy, he can go anywhere, in fact we encourage you to [add him to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1021287182641668096&permissions=0&scope=bot). While Family Guy doesnt really need any permissions, its recomended you at least give him the regular member perms.
