Benbebot is a family of a couple of discord bots all here in this repository. Currently, there is good old Benbebot (Main Bot) and Family Guy.

# Benbebot Help

If you have just added Benbebot or are looking to, here is all the stuff he can do (at the moment, its always being expanded). All commands are to be ran by just typing in a chat `bbb <command> [args]`.

* Download videos from almost any service (a full list of supported sites can be found [here](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)).
	This can be done with the command `download [<format> <quality>] <url>`
* Run a gmod server.
	This is on by default, at the moment the server might go down and I will have to manually restart the p2p id. In order to get a link to join the gmod server use the command `gmod`

Short list I know (it used to be alot bigger, check out the old repository if intrested).
