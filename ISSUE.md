## [create an issue](https://github.com/Benbebop/benbebots/issues/new)

Usually if something goes wrong with the bot it will provide an error message in one of the log channels in the Benbebots discord server, if not then you can skip this. If you are not a part of this server then you will want to join it and find the relavent error message. In your issue you will want to add a refrence (ideal) or an image of the error message. Only include a refrence if the error message is in the Benbebots server.

other then that just describe what you were trying to do at the time and what went wrong.

Thanks for deciding to help the development effort.
